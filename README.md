Code explaination
  for map display
    The printmap function takes a two-dimensional string array k as its parameter and prints out each element of the array to the console. The main function initializes a two-dimensional string array map with 77 rows and 77 columns, and an index array index with 29 rows and 2 columns. The printmap function is then called with map as its parameter, causing the map to be printed out to the console.
