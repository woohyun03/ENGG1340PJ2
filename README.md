### How to Play
1.	Compile the program and run the executable.
2.	Enter the names of the two players.
3.	Players take turns rolling the Yut (a special ticket) to determine how many steps they can move their pieces, called Mal, on the game board.
4.	If a player rolls a special ticket (e.g., Platinum or Diamond), they get to roll the Yut again.
5.	When it's a player's turn, they choose which Mal to move based on the ticket they received.
6.	The Mal will move according to the ticket, and its new position will be displayed.
7.	If a Mal lands on a spot occupied by the opponent's Mal, the opponent's Mal will be removed from the game board (killed).
8.	Players continue to take turns until one player meets the winning condition.
9.	The game ends and the winner is announced.

### The introduction and rule of the game

 Yutnori is a traditional Korean board game that has been played for hundreds of years. It is a game that involves strategy, luck, and skill. The game is played on a square board that has four corners and a center point. Each player has three game pieces, which are called Mal. They move around the board in a clockwise direction. The goal of the game is to be " << endl"the first player to move all of their game pieces from their starting point to the finish line in the center of the board.

To start the game, each player takes turns rolling four sticks called yut, in this game it is called Ticket, since the game's theme is Train. The number of x in the display represents the number of possible moves. There are six possible outcomes of a yut roll, which correspond to the six different types of 

## Moves:
1. Bronze Ticket: Move one space
2. Silver Ticket: Move two spaces.
3. Gold Ticket: Move three spaces.
4. Platinum Ticket: Move four spaces and roll again.
5. Diamond Ticket: Move five spaces and roll again.
6. Secret Ticket: Move one space backward.

There are some special rules in this game. If you can move to the same position with the opponent's mal, then you can throw yut one more time and make the opponent's mal move back to the starting point. In a similar situation, when one mal can be positioned on the same spot as another mal, the two mals need is a certain path that the Mal must follow on the board. When mals are placed on the corner of the map. Mals will move to the center of map, and when they moved to the center of the map mals will move toward the end point.

### **Game Components**
1.	main.cpp: The `main.cpp` file contains the main game loop and logic.

2.	Functions.h: The `Functions.h` file contains various functions to handle game mechanics such as ticket rolling, Mal movement, and Mal killing.

3.	Map.h: The `Map.h` file defines the game board and the methods to manipulate and display it.

4.	Player.h: The `Player.h` file defines the player class, which includes player names and Mals.

5.	Station.h: The `Station.h` file defines the station class, which represents locations on the game board.

6.	Mal.h: The `Mal.h` file defines the Mal class, which represents the game pieces.
